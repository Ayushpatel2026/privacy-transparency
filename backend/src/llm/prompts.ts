The following transparency event contains information about the purpose of data collection, data storage location, encryption methods and transmission methods. 

**TRANSPARENCY EVENT**:
${JSON.stringify(transparencyEvent, null, 2)}

The following is the privacy policy of the sleep tracker application:

**PRIVACY POLICY**:
${privacyPolicy}

The following are the user's consent preferences - what the user has agreed to regarding data collection and processing:

${pipedaRegulations ? `**SPECIFIC PIPEDA REGULATIONS**:\n${pipedaRegulations}\n` : ''}

**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. Evaluate if the data collection aligns with the stated purpose
2. Verify if the transparency event information complies with the privacy policy and user consent preferences. 
3. Assess compliance with the specified regulatory frameworks and provided regulations only. DO NOT use any other regulations.
4. Identify potential privacy risks and their severity according to the below critera: 

**RISK ASSESSMENT CRITERIA**:
- **HIGH RISK**: Clear violation of regulations, privacy policy, or user consent; unauthorized data collection; insecure storage/transmission
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Technically compliant but suboptimal practices; vague purposes; excessive data collection; third-party sharing concerns
- **LOW RISK**: Fully compliant with minimal privacy concerns; clear purpose; proper consent; secure handling
